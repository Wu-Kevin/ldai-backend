"""
A POST request is an attempt to create a new resource from an existing one. 
The existing resource may be the parent of the new one in a data-structure sense, 
the way the root of a tree is the parent of all its leaf nodes. Or the existing resource may be a special 
"factory" resource whose only purpose is to generate other resources. The 
representation sent along with a POST request describes the initial state of 
the new resource. As with PUT, a POST request doesnâ€™t need to include a representation at all.
